# InfitineScroll

Based on course '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript' created by Brad Traversy (https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/), I would like to present a project 11/20: Infinite Scroll.

Display blog posts from jsonplaceholder and add infinite scroll to fetch posts and also add filter box

# Project Specification

* Create UI & custom CSS loader animation
* Fetch initial posts from API and display
* Scroll down, show loader and fetch next set of posts
* Add filtering for fetched posts
